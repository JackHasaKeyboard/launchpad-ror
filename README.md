# Launchpad (Î²)

Launchpad is a repository of online tools for enthusiasts of technical mediums.

It was inspired by the sheer immensity of smart, creative tools that exist online and the unfortunate lack of a way to organize them... on your local machine you have "programs" but out there on the internet not so much.

It may look pretty (at least I hope) but the way it works is very fundamentally simple, almost like a wrapper for SQL that just happens to render HTML in a web browser.
